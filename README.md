1. upLife is a platform where users can create and share their diary.
2. upLife is a Full-Stack web application where the frontend was built with TypeScript, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS and the backend built with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB. The database stores account information and diaries created by users. To create a diary, a user has to sign up with a username and password, then login. A user can view diaries created by other users, but cannot edit or delete if the diary was not created by the user.
3. I spent 7 hours on this project.
4. The website is deployed to https://uplife.heppoko.space/
